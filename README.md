# FancyMath

A small sample project to demonstrate building Gems using C extensions.  The git history provides good documentation for how this project was built.

## Usage

It is not recommended that you install this gem.  Use bin/console to start an IRB session that will automatically have loaded the FancyMath module.

There is only one module function available, FancyMath.add.  Use it with integers: ```FancyMath.add(1, 2)```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
